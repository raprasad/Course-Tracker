Course Tracker is a database used to record information about courses offered by the Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology at Harvard University.

Specifically, the database contains year over year information regarding the teachers of a class, class budget, textbooks, enrollment, physical classroom space required, number of sections, etc.

Currently, this project uses the Django web framework--specifically the administrative interface and models.
